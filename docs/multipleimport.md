# Importing multiple sheets
Fairy Key comes with an example `Sheets` folder, which is located in the root directory of `FairyKey.exe`. This folder is also automatically created if it does not exist. Additional folders can be used within the `Sheets` folder for further organization (currently a folder depth of `1` is supported).

1. Place your sheet `.txt` file(s) in the `Sheets` folder
2. Launch `FairyKey.exe`
3. Sheets will appear in the **Library**

!!! example "Tip"
    Fairy Key can automatically detect and load new **single** sheets without restarting the application.
