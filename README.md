## ðŸ“˜ Wiki & Documentation
This is a repo for Fairy Key's wiki: [wiki.fairykey.app](https://wiki.fairykey.app/)

## Contributing
The wiki uses [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) to handle displaying content and deploying through Github Actions.

Changes to wiki pages can be made directly from Github from their counterpart `.md` files, or the entire repo can be cloned and pull-requested through Git.
When a commit is made, a workflow CI is setup with Github actions to deploy the site with the new build (takes a few minutes to complete after committing).
